## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

### Before
```bash
# Manual steps
1. Deploy CDK stack
2. Get outputs from CloudFormation
3. Manually update frontend/.env
4. Build frontend manually
5. Deploy frontend to hosting (manual)
6. No monitoring setup
7. No WAF protection
```

### After
```bash
# One command!
./scripts/deploy-and-configure.sh [dev|staging|prod]

Automatically:
✅ Validates environment
✅ Builds frontend (if needed)
✅ Deploys CDK stack
✅ Configures frontend .env
✅ Deploys to CloudFront (if configured)
✅ Sets up monitoring
✅ Enables WAF
