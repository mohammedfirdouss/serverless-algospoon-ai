# Serverless AlgoSpoon AI

A personalized, serverless meal planner and recipe generator powered by **AWS Bedrock**.

**AlgoSpoon AI** is a full-stack, event-driven application that leverages Generative AI to solve the real-world problem of specialized meal planning. It custom-generates recipes based on a user's unique dietary restrictions (e.g., allergies, keto, vegan) and available ingredients.

Built on a robust, serverless architecture derived from the **AWS AI Stack**, this project demonstrates secure user authentication, real-time AI streaming, and complex asynchronous processing on AWS.
